# Python-assessment-001


Welcome to your Python practical assessment! This challenge is designed to test your understanding of Python fundamentals, including **variables, strings, lists, loops, and dictionaries**.

## 📂 File Structure

You should have the following two files in your folder:

1.  `assessment.py` - **(EDIT THIS FILE)**
    * This is where you will write your solutions.
    * Look for the `# TODO` comments inside the functions.
2.  `test_assessment.py` - **(DO NOT EDIT)**
    * This file contains the automated tests that grade your work.
    * Do not modify this file, or the tests may break!

## 🚀 How to Start

1.  Open `assessment.py` in your code editor (VS Code, Pycharm, etc.).
2.  You will see empty functions with `pass` inside them.
3.  Read the **Docstring** (the text inside `""" """`) to understand what the function needs to do.
4.  Replace `pass` with your own Python code.

## 🧪 How to Run the Tests

To check if your code is correct, you need to run the **test file**, not the assessment file.

### Step 1: Open your Terminal
Make sure your terminal/command prompt is pointing to the folder where these files are saved.

### Step 2: Run the command
Type the following command and hit Enter:

```bash
python test_assessment.py
```
